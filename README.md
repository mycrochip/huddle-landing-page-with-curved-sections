### What I learned

A bit late for this but, I got to incorporate font awesome icons into my HTML code.

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/df7b35a0c6.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <div class="footer-socials">
    <a href="" class="icon">
      <i class="fa-brands fa-facebook-square"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="" class="icon">
      <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="" class="icon">
      <i class="fa-brands fa-twitter-square"></i>
    </a>
  </div>
</body>
```
